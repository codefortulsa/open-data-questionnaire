{"name":"Open Data Questionnaire","tagline":"Dervied from 2013 Minneapolis Open Data Questionnaire Press Release","body":"Dear Candidate,\r\n\r\nWe are Code for Tulsa, a brigade of Code for America. Code for Tulsa is part of a national movement of citizens, technologists, and public servants working together to create novel technologies to address civic and community issues. Nationally, Code for America associated initiatives have created 20+ civic applications. Code for Tulsa has spurred the development of several local projects, including Tulsa Road Information Feed, Oklahoma Boundary Service, Tulsa Fire Department Dispatch, and the White House recognized Open Search Map.\r\n\r\nGroups such as Code for Tulsa rely on ready access to government data and information to create innovative community applications. Across the nation, cities are enabling this access by passing resolutions, executive orders, and ordinances that promote or mandate the release of city data.\r\nThe City of Tulsa has a significant opportunity to improve, and we feel that open access to municipal data is a vital issue. It is the tool of government transparency for our time, the foundation of community and civic technology innovation, and an enabler of democratic participation in government processes. For these reasons, we would like to understand the stances of candidates for municipal and county offices regarding Open Data.\r\n\r\nIncluded with this letter is a short questionnaire concerning open data. Please take some time to respond to the questionnaire and return the questionnaire using the included, stamped envelope. If you are unfamiliar with the issue of Open Data, we invite you to review the included FAQ. If you have any questions, or are interested in meeting with members of the local open data community, feel free to email code-for-tulsa@googlegroups.com.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nCode for Tulsa Contributors\f\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Please note**, your responses will be published by Code for Tulsa and/or shared with media.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. What is your general view on government open data and promoting the social and economic health of Tulsa?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. What is your general view on government open data as it relates to government transparency, accountability, and public participation in Tulsa?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Based on your experience, does the City of Tulsa currently provide enough open, standardized, digital data? What kinds of government information or specific data sets would you like to see made more available to citizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Many datasets controlled by the city are made up exclusively of legally public data. Do you support making such datasets available online for public reuse the default transparency and openness policy for the city within one year of taking office?\r\n\r\nYes | No (Circle One)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Do you support making city open data sets available in the most standard, non-proprietary, reusable, and machine readable format possible the default policy?\r\n\r\nYes | No (Circle One)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. What process will you use to determine which city controlled datasets should not be shared with the public online in an open standard way (e.g. via a city open data online repository)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Are there specific data sets with only public data that you feel should not be made available to the public in downloadable formats or for direct public use at this time? (Data sets with legally defined private information are by their nature not included. An example of a more sensitive \"public\" data set is the City of Seattle making near-realtime 911 call data available on a public online map.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. If elected, what will your strategy be to implement the city open data policy that you envision and have described in your responses above?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\nWhat is Open Data?\r\nMost often, ‘open data’ refers to the idea that data controlled by a government body should be accessible to citizens and other government bodies in a structured format. The concept of open data can be broken down into three levels:\r\nLegal access to data - Citizens have the basic right to access government data\r\nReasonable access to data - Government data can be accessed at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable time frame\r\nAccess to structured data - Government data can be retrieved in an open format that computer programs can readily understand and process. For example, a CSV is an open, structured format, while a PDF is not.\r\n\r\nWhat is an Open Standard?\r\nIn the context of open data, an open standard typically refers to a data format whose specification is freely available to be read and implemented by anybody. Data available in an open standard is often the most accessible to analysts, journalists, and programmers, as anybody can access the tools and information needed to work with that data. Because of this, open standards often support competitive markets of applications and organizations that perform similar services on similar types of data.\r\n\r\nDo City reports provide access to city data?\r\nNot to the level that open data does. A report published by the city represents a finished presentation of data. The report includes analysis, formatting and layout, and commentary that is meant to be read by people, and often meant to be read by a certain audience. While these presentations of data are valuable, they usually do not provide the raw, structured data required by others who wish to create their own analyses, presentations, or new applications.\r\n\r\nWhich cities officially support open data?\r\nA report by the San Diego Data Bank - sandiegodata.org/reports/municipal-open-data-policies/ - recently analyzed the policies of 8 major US and Canadian cities that have implemented open data programs in the last seven years. These cities include Austin, Chicago, Philadelphia, Portland, New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. At the federal level, the White House has also implemented an open data policy for the executive branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-44188012-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
